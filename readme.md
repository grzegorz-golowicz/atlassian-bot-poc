# Atlassian Bot Proofs of Concept

## Overview
This repository contains a proof of concept of chatbot that is using data from Atlassian Confluence and JIRa. 
Idea of the bot is to provide information about the project, team, sprint, etc.

## Assumptions
* This project is purely a proof of concept and is not intended to be used in production.
* I'm not Python developer, and using this technology only for early prototyping. Don't expect production grade code quality, extensive testing, or sticking to best practices.
* This project is not intended to be a full-featured chatbot. It's a simple prototype that demonstrates how to integrate with Atlassian APIs.
